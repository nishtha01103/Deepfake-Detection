# Deepfake-Detection
This project aims to develop a robust deepfake detection model that focuses on facial and             lip synchronization anomalies as primary indicators. By analyzing discrepancies in facial expressions, lip movements, and corresponding audio, the proposed system will identify inconsistencies that are typical in deepfake videos.
